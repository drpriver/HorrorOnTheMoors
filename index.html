<p>
You are in Velyx, a border town on the northern edge of the Karynthian
empire. The Karynthians invaded this area a few hundred years ago, but the
Karynthian empire is in decline. They have withdrawn their armies from this
region, leaving this town and others like it to defend itself. It rains a lot
around Velyx. There’s only two ways to make a living around here now - farm
and rob tombs - and you’ve committed too many felonies to move to more
civilized parts. With no imperial army to enforce the ban on robbing the
ancient tombs of the natives, it’s time to crack open some sealed burial
mounds. What the imperials said about unleashing ancient evils is just
superstition anyway, you need silver to feed your addiction to opium.

<h2 id="recruiting-npcs">Recruiting NPCs</h2>
<div>

<p>
Hirelings are limited by local availability. Hirelings can be recruited from
taverns, from mercenary companies, or from paying for an announcement from
the village crier. You can do more than one at once. Each attempt will cost
5-ish gp and result in a random pool of candidates. You don't have to hire
everyone.
</p>
<p>
There are generally 4 types of characters that can be recruited to help the
party: classed NPCs, men-at-arms, unskilled hirelings and skilled experts.
If too many hirelings die, base morale for hirelings may be reduced and/or
higher wages may be demanded. Fear points are not tracked for men-at-arms and
unskilled hirelings, as that concept is rolled into morale.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="classed-npcs">Classed NPCs</h3>
<div>

<p>
Classed NPCs are adventurers, equal in status to the PCs. These characters
will generally join an adventure for a share of the loot and will
contribute to shared expenses, but others might negotiate better deals,
especially if their skills are rare or they are higher level than the
party. Generally, this will be roleplayed in person. These characters do
not need to roll morale.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="men-at-arms">Men-at-arms</h3>
<div>

<p>
Men-at-arms are warrior-types with average stats for their race (ex: all
10s for a human). They are typically level 1 warriors, but higher level
men-at-arms exist. They must be paid a fortnight's wage up-front, even if
the adventure is shorter. The minimum wage for men-at-arms is 1gp per day,
but a bad reputation may drive this price higher. If the men-at-arms are to
go in the dungeon, they must be paid double as hazard pay. The 1gp/day is
for mercenaries who are just hired to protect the party in overland travel
or to guard the campsite, etc. Additionally, higher wages will boost the
morale of men-at-arms, making them less likely to abandon the party, flee
in the face of supernatural monsters or when outnumbered, etc.
</p>
<p>
Men-at-arms have 8hp, proficiency in simple, martial weapons, armor,
shields.  They have +1 bab, +2 fort save and no significant secondary
skills.  They also get a special ability (usually a feat which they
shouldn't qualify for, but YOLO).
</p>
<p>
In this region, men-at-arms fall into the following equipment load-outs.
</p>

<li> AC 16, 1d10 damage, 9 hp</li>
<li> Weapon Focus: Axes</li>
<li> 4 free slots (note that dwarves suffer reduced heavy encumbrance penalties)</li>
<li> Double wages</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="def">
<h4 id="elf">Elf</h4>
<div>

<ul>
<li> Leather, Longbow, 20 arrows</li>
<li> AC: 13, 1d8 damage, 7 hp</li>
<li> +1 to ranged attack due to dex</li>
<li> Precise shot feat</li>
<li> 6 free slots</li>
<li> Double wages</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<p>
You can change out a men-at-arms equipment, but you must provide it. It
must fit their style or they will be annoyed at you, lowering their morale
(defenders don't want to use greataxes). They will not pay for it. Their
money is for food, drugs, alcohol and women. You can loan them equipment.
Note that if a character dies, it is assumed their armor is badly
damaged/destroyed.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="unskilled-hirelings">Unskilled Hirelings</h3>
<div>

<p>
Unskilled hirelings are commoner-types with average stats for their race.
They have no signficant combat skill and will choose to run or cower
instead of fighting. They are useful for holding torches, carrying
supplies, lifting things, cooking meals, etc. 3sp/day is the minimum wage
for them.  Unskilled hirelings are also paid a fortnight's wages up front
if going on an adventure (day laborers for tasks in town are paid daily).
If they are to go in the dungeon, they should be paid double as hazard
pay.
</p>
<p>
Hirelings will generally not do dangerous things willingly and will not
fight in combat. If forced to fight, they will instead flee or cower. They
still occupy space in the party's ranks and may be targeted by monsters. In
the face of the supernatural or otherwise particulary scary monsters, they
must check morale. Higher wages and good treatment improves their morale.
</p>
<p>
Unskilled hirelings have 3 hp, no weapon or armor proficiencies, no save
bonuses.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="skilled-experts">Skilled Experts</h3>
<div>

<p>
These are characters who possess a particular skill, but are not otherwise
adventurers. They generally will not fight. Payment is negotiated based on
the task.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="character-cravings">Character Cravings</h2>
<div>

<p>
Your character has some kind of craving: choose or roll on the table below.
</p>
<p>
Failure to satisfy this craving will lead to negative outcomes per the
referee's discretion. Your craving must be satisfied an average of once
a day and you can go no longer than a week before suffering withdrawl.
</p>
<p>
Since you are a degenerate, you can't purchase more than a week's supply
ahead of time. You would just binge on your supply.

<h2 id="character-upkeep">Character Upkeep</h2>
<div>

<p>
When staying in town, characters need to either rent rooms at the inn
(2gp/day), purchase a house to stay in or befriend locals. Additionally, they
must eat at the cost of 5sp/day. These costs represent good meals and good
rooms.  If a character cannot afford this, they do not lose fear points.
Additionally, until they spend a week in good living conditions they suffer a
-1 penalty to attacks, saving throws and skill checks.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="fear-points">Fear Points</h2>
<div>

<p>
Encounters with spooky monsters and other events will cause accumulation of
fear points. Each encounter with the undead causes each party member to gain
1 fear point. A failed save against a fear effect from an undead causes that
party member to gain 3 fear points. A character who has 20 fear points goes
insane. Spending a week in town reduces the character’s fear points by 3.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="adventuring-season">Adventuring Season</h2>
<div>

<p>
Due to rain, flooding and general bogginess, the barrowmoor is essentially
inaccessible during the fall, winter and early spring. The moor becomes
accessible in early May and is essentially inaccessible by mid September.
