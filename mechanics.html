<h2 id="spell-recovery">Spell Recovery</h2>
<div>

<p>
After 24 hours of resting and light activity, 1st level spells are regained.
Another 24 hours later, 2nd level spells, etc.
</p>
<p>
Some special abilities (for example, healing devotion) will be ruled to be
spell-like and recharge by like a spell of an appropriate level.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="recruiting-npcs">Recruiting NPCs</h2>
<div>

<p>
Hirelings are limited by local availability. Hirelings can be recruited from
taverns, from mercenary companies, or from paying for an announcement from
the village crier. You can do more than one at once. Each attempt will cost
5-ish gp and result in a random pool of candidates. You don't have to hire
everyone.
</p>
<p>
There are generally 4 types of characters that can be recruited to help the
party: classed NPCs, men-at-arms, unskilled hirelings and skilled experts.
If too many hirelings die, base morale for hirelings may be reduced and/or
higher wages may be demanded. Fear points are not tracked for men-at-arms and
unskilled hirelings, as that concept is rolled into morale.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="classed-npcs">Classed NPCs</h3>
<div>

<p>
Classed NPCs are adventurers, equal in status to the PCs. These characters
will generally join an adventure for a share of the loot and will
contribute to shared expenses, but others might negotiate better deals,
especially if their skills are rare or they are higher level than the
party. Generally, this will be roleplayed in person. These characters do
not need to roll morale.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="men-at-arms">Men-at-arms</h3>
<div>

<p>
Men-at-arms are warrior-types with average stats for their race (ex: all
10s for a human). They are typically level 1 warriors, but higher level
men-at-arms exist. They must be paid a fortnight's wage up-front, even if
the adventure is shorter. The minimum wage for men-at-arms is 1gp per day,
but a bad reputation may drive this price higher. If the men-at-arms are to
go in the dungeon, they must be paid double as hazard pay. The 1gp/day is
for mercenaries who are just hired to protect the party in overland travel
or to guard the campsite, etc. Additionally, higher wages will boost the
morale of men-at-arms, making them less likely to abandon the party, flee
in the face of supernatural monsters or when outnumbered, etc.
</p>
<p>
Men-at-arms have 8hp, proficiency in simple, martial weapons, armor,
shields.  They have +1 bab, +2 fort save and no significant secondary
skills.  They also get a special ability (usually a feat which they
shouldn't qualify for, but YOLO).
</p>
<p>
In this region, men-at-arms fall into the following equipment load-outs.
</p>

<p>
You can change out a men-at-arms equipment, but you must provide it. It
must fit their style or they will be annoyed at you, lowering their morale
(defenders don't want to use greataxes). They will not pay for it. Their
money is for food, drugs, alcohol and women. You can loan them equipment.
Note that if a character dies, it is assumed their armor is badly
damaged/destroyed.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="unskilled-hirelings">Unskilled Hirelings</h3>
<div>

<p>
Unskilled hirelings are commoner-types with average stats for their race.
They have no signficant combat skill and will choose to run or cower
instead of fighting. They are useful for holding torches, carrying
supplies, lifting things, cooking meals, etc. 3sp/day is the minimum wage
for them.  Unskilled hirelings are also paid a fortnight's wages up front
if going on an adventure (day laborers for tasks in town are paid daily).
If they are to go in the dungeon, they should be paid double as hazard
pay.
</p>
<p>
Hirelings will generally not do dangerous things willingly and will not
fight in combat. If forced to fight, they will instead flee or cower. They
still occupy space in the party's ranks and may be targeted by monsters. In
the face of the supernatural or otherwise particulary scary monsters, they
must check morale. Higher wages and good treatment improves their morale.
</p>
<p>
Unskilled hirelings have 3 hp, no weapon or armor proficiencies, no save
bonuses.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="skilled-experts">Skilled Experts</h3>
<div>

<p>
These are characters who possess a particular skill, but are not otherwise
adventurers. They generally will not fight. Payment is negotiated based on
the task.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="some-tomb-robbing-rules">Some Tomb Robbing Rules</h2>
<div>
<h3 id="dungeon-turn">Dungeon Turn</h3>
<div>

<p>
The below rules refer to "turns" in an exploration context. These should be
interpreted as 10 minute intervals.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="bricked-up-walls">Bricked-Up Walls</h3>
<div>

<p>
You might encountered walls that have been bricked up. These walls are
breakable with the right tools and some time.
</p>
</div>
<div>

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="table_header">
<th>No. of Sledge Hammers </th>

<tr class="odd">

</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div>

<p>
Breaking down a brick wall is quite loud and will likely attract the
attention of any monsters wandering nearby.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="sealed-mounds">Sealed Mounds</h3>
<div>

<p>
Some Burial Mounds are sealed with stone doors. A Sledge Hammer and spike
will be needed to break it open. This takes 2 turns and makes a hell of a
lot of noise, or 1 turn with two working at it (each needs tools).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="buried-mounds">Buried Mounds</h3>
<div>

<p>
Some burial mounds have been buried in dirt over the years and will need to
be excavated to be entered.
</p>
<p>
Excavation requires 3d4+4 hours (1 hour equals 6 turns) of digging with
appropriate digging tools (shovels, etc) and equipment purchased in town.
For each 2 PCs or hirelings devoted to the task the result will be reduced
by 1 hour to a minimum of 2 hours to excavate the entrance to the mound.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="searching-a-lot-of-small-containers">Searching a lot of small containers</h3>
<div>

<p>
There are locations with a huge number of small containers or alcoves to
search. A character can search 10 such containers in 10 minutes. For
example, 5 characters searching 145 alcoves will take 3 turns (5 * 10 * 3 =
150).
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="character-upkeep">Character Upkeep</h2>
<div>

<p>
When staying in town, characters need to either rent rooms at the inn
(2gp/day), purchase a house to stay in or befriend locals. Additionally, they
must eat at the cost of 5sp/day. These costs represent good meals and good
rooms.  If a character cannot afford this, they do not lose fear points.
Additionally, until they spend a week in good living conditions they suffer a
-1 penalty to attacks, saving throws and skill checks.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="fear-points">Fear Points</h2>
<div>

<p>
Encounters with spooky monsters and other events will cause accumulation of
fear points. Each encounter with the undead causes each party member to gain
1 fear point. A failed save against a fear effect from an undead causes that
party member to gain 3 fear points. A character who has 20 fear points goes
insane. Spending a week in town reduces the character’s fear points by 3.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="resurrection">Resurrection</h2>
<div>

<p>
Major Temples can cast raise dead for 10,000gp. A raised character loses a level.
</p>
<p>
Druid Groves can cast reincarnate. You reincarnate into a random humanoid,
lose a level, but is free. This requires the druids to like you.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="supplies">Supplies</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Supplies can be purchased for 5sp.
</li>
<li>
Supplies represent food, clean water, dry socks, etc.
</li>
<li>
You need supplies or you die.
<ul>
<li>
After 1 day without supplies, you become fatigued.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Half a day later you become exhausted.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Half a day after that you die.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Supplies take up a slot for a single day and are consumed in the morning
when in the wilderness.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="encumbrance">Encumbrance</h2>
<div>

<p>
You can carry your strength score in slots without being encumbered
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Assume hirelings have 10 in all stats.
</li>
<li>
You can carry up to double this amount and be heavily encumbered
</li>
</ul>
<div>

<p>
Heavily Encumbered means:
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Move at half speed (unless you're a dwarf)
</li>
<li>
-4 penalty to dex (unless you're a dwarf)
</li>
<li>
Extra -4 penalty to ACP (especially if you're a dwarf)

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Movement is 5e-style, though you still have to spend a move action to be granted
that movement in the first place
</li>
<li>
In other words, you can move, take an action then finish your move
</li>
<li>
5-ft step cannot move you out of someone’s threatened zone (can move into someones threatened zone though)
</li>
<li>
Side-based initiative, with interleaved turns, but without rerolling each round
</li>
<li>
At beginning of combat, roll a d20 + median initiative modifier vs their same roll to see who goes first.
</li>
<li>
Really basic grid +battlemaps + abstract tokens
</li>
<li>
No concentration Skill
</li>
<li>
If you take damage while casting, there is a flat 50% chance you fizzle the spell.
</li>
<li>
Casting while engaged in melee ordinarily provokes (with the usual caveats for swift-action casting, etc.)
</li>
<li>
Melee range attack spells (such as inflict wounds) do not provoke and area spells originating from you (like burning hands) do not provoke.
</li>
<li>
No Touch AC (things that target touch instead target AC, but at +4)
</li>
<li>
Melee full attacking is a standard action, ranged full attacking is full-action as normal
</li>
<li>
Spell Resistance works on all spells (including nonsense SR: no spells)
</li>
<li>
Spell Resistance = Psionic Resistance
</li>
<li>
Undead/Constructs can be critically-hit/snuck attacked
</li>
<li>
Flanking is gone, except thieves can flank
</li>
<li>
That one stance is its own thing that gives +2 with adjacent allies
</li>
<li>
Bull rush doesn’t provoke
</li>
<li>
Touch Spells discharge after 4 hours (or per spell description)
</li>
<li>
Sunder, bull rush, trip doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity
</li>
<li>
Grapple doesn’t need a touch attack
</li>
<li>
Grapple can be defended against by strength (bab+str+other), dex (bab+dex+other), or escape artist (escape ranks + dex + other)
</li>
<li>
Soft Cover is reduced to +2 AC instead of +4. We'll be flexible on whether or not
you can get a clear shot in theater-of-the-mind combats
</li>
<li>
Soft cover still prevents attacks of opportunity (aka spears from the second rank)
</li>
<li>
Targeting is from center of square to center of square for cover, line of sight,
etc. in combat.
</li>
<li>
Reserve Feats are spell-like abilities

<p>
Good roads bonus is applied at most once per day and at least two hexes of good
roads must be covered that day.
</p>
<p>
When exploring uncharted terrain, a blank hexmap is used. When you enter a
hex, adjacent hexes are revealed. Mountains and some hill hexes might be
revealed from farther away depending on general conditions.
</p>
<p>
Generally, every 3 hours of adventuring and dungeon-crawling counts as 1
overland movement point.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="forced-march">Forced March</h3>
<div>

<p>
A forced march allows the party to add one movement point for that day.
A forced march causes you to become fatigued. A full day of rest is needed
to recover. NPCs don't like forced marching and will ask for rest. Refusal
can provoke morale checks.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="partial-movement">Partial Movement</h3>
<div>

<p>
If the party has leftover movement points at the end of the day, they can
partially move into the next hex. They remain in their current hex, but
they are credited with moving towards that hex. This credit is not
transferrable &mdash; if they decide during the night they need to go a
different direction, the points are wasted, and if you need to go the
opposite way they are actually subtracted from the next day's allowance to
get back to neutral.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<div>

<p>
Each time the party attempts to move into a hex, the referee determines if
they get lost by rolling dice based on the hex and local conditions. If it
is determined they would get lost, the party navigator can make a reactive
survival check at DC 20 to instead not get lost. You cannot take 5 on this
check.  If you get lost, you did not move to your target hex.
</p>
<p>
A party that has passed through a hex before does not chance getting lost
from just moving through the hex. This represents remembering natural
landmarks, where to turn, etc. The referee may determine that enough time
has passed and the hex changed enough that the party is at risk of getting
lost again (perhaps at reduced probability). For example, traveling through
a deciduous forest in winter is very different than in the summer - almost
nothing looks the same.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="being-lost">Being Lost</h3>
<div>

<p>
When you get lost, you are lost in your current hex. To find their way, the
party must spend hex points equal to the cost spent to enter the hex they
are in, and then make a survival check to stop being lost. Failure means
that the party is still lost.  Repeat this process until the party finds
their way (either by a successful roll or by some other process). After
each failure, the referee will roll to see if the party has wandered into a
different hex.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="scouting">Scouting</h3>
<div>

<p>
There are generally 3 kinds of features in a hex: overt, non-obvious and
secret.  An overt feature is something like a town that would be
encountered by anyone passing through the area and is automatically
encountered. A non-obvious feature is something off the beaten path, but
would be found if you scouted the area, like a haunted mansion.  Secret
features are things that can only be found if you know to look for them,
like following tracks to an ogre's lair or an ancient temple hidden by
overgrown vines.  Secret features can generally only be found if the party
knows they exist or have some clues that point them towards it.
</p>
<p>
To scout a hex, spend the same number of movement points as if you were
entering the hex. Additionally, a check is made to see if the party has
gotten lost, with a reactive survival check allowed if they have. Failure
means the party is lost, which is resolved in the same manner as above. A
success reveals the non-obvious features of the hex. Some hexes have no
features, some hexes have several.
</p>
<p>
Lost characters may randomly stumble into features.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="random-encounters">Random Encounters</h3>
<div>

<p>
Each movement into a hex will require a check for wandering monsters, as
will scouting a hex and attempts to cease being lost. If you are just
moving and the navigator has achieved competency for that hex, a reactive
survival check is allowed to avoid the encounter.
</p>
<p>
The base encounter chance is 1-in-6, but the referee may adjust this
probability based on party actions, party size, conditions on the ground,
etc. A suitably large mercenary force may scare away encounters.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="camping">Camping</h3>
<div>

<p>
When camping in the wilderness, the referee will check to see if something
happens. Finding a good campsite in a hex is DC 15 and can be done at the
cost of 1 movement point. The DC can be adjusted based on local conditions.
Once a campsite in a hex is found, you can return to that campsite when in
that hex at no additional movement cost. A good campsite halves the chance
of a nighttime encounter.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="mounts">Mounts</h3>
<div>

<p>
Mounts have their own movement allowance. If the entire party is mounted,
the party can move at this higher allowance. Mounts have restrictions on
what terrain they can enter. Also consult this if you have pack animals.
A party travels at the rate of its slowest member.

<h2 id="skill-checks">Skill Checks</h2>
<div>

<p>
In normal 3e, you can almost always take 10 outside of combat or
time-sensitive encounters. However, you also are not supposed to know the DC
before you roll, so that taking 10 is a hidden information game. This is
incompatible with my style, so taking 10 is replaced with taking 5 and
instead represents competency &ndash; if you would succeed with a below average
result, you succeed in normal circumstances.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="taking-5">Taking 5</h3>
<div>

<p>
When you need to make a skill check, if you would succeed on a roll of 5,
you don't need to roll and instead succeed.  This can be applied after
rolling as the DM doesn't always know your bonuses. This rule does not
apply in stressful or distracting situations like combat and does not
apply to knowledge checks. You cannot take 5 on "reactive" skill checks.
